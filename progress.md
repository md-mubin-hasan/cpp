I forgot almost most of the topics of c++ i learned back in the days, planning to revise all of those once again.
What I remembered today while solving atcoder contest problem is that the function pow(a,b) = $a^b$.
When I am outputting a direct computational result which is larger than $1*10^9$, I should at first store it in a long int variable then output the result. For example, instead of doing this ``` cout<<pow(9,9); ```, I should store the value of pow(9,9) in a long int variable then output it.
