I forgot almost most of the topics of c++ i learned back in the days, planning to revise all of those once again.
What I remembered today while solving atcoder contest problem is that the function pow(a,b) = $a^b$.
When I am outputting a direct computational result which is larger than $1*10^9$, I should at first store it in a long int variable then output the result. For example, instead of doing this ``` cout<<pow(9,9); ```, I should store the value of pow(9,9) in a long int variable then output it. 
There is a couple of ways to convert int to character which can be found in geekforgeeks. I am comfused of the fact that whether I have to know all of them or not, or which method is the most efficient one. Most simpler one that I found is ```char(65);```
I should have a rough idea of the ascii codes/ascii table. I should know that 48 represents '0' as a char, 65 represents 'A' as a char, and 97 represents 'a' as a char.
